# Malware-Detection-
This repository contains a project focused on detecting malware using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and a Random Forest Classifier to identify and classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam).

**Overview**
The project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to preprocess text data, create a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance on a dataset of email messages. By leveraging NLP techniques like stemming, stop word removal, and vectorization, the model is trained to effectively differentiate between malicious (spam) and benign (ham) emails.

**Key Features**
**Text Preprocessing:** Includes cleaning the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, and applying stemming using the PorterStemmer.
**Feature Extraction:** Uses CountVectorizer to transform the cleaned text data into a numerical format suitable for model training.
**Model Training:** Implements a Random Forest Classifier to train on the preprocessed data. The model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%.
**Performance Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is calculated to assess its ability to correctly classify emails.
**Prediction:** A sample email from the dataset is classified using the trained model, showcasing the end-to-end process from raw text input to final prediction.

**Dataset**
The project uses the 'spam_ham_dataset.csv', which contains labeled email data. Each email is marked as either spam or ham, enabling supervised learning for the classification model.
